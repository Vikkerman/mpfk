It's my first attempt to create a personalized media player what easier to handle by my kids.
Easy to Drag and Drop Folders/Files to playlist.
Set Folder where Cartoons are, and the app will search for any not "sample" movie files
then create a Mini icon for every single movie by creating a snapshot in runtime. So my kids can 
surf on movilist then choose what they want to watch.
Easy to handle by arrow keys, skip between movies by up and down keys, control the volume by laeft and rigth arrows as usual.
Maybe the only personal thig is to set default folder for movies, and mini icons for those. (And maybe voice control later)
It's could be totally resizeable, but no point, because of my kids are less then 6 eyars old, and they don't need to resize anything.. :)

Using vlcj library (https://github.com/caprica/vlcj) for most of the movie things.
